# austism_detection_in_adults_using_machine_learning
I developed this project using several supervised machine learning classification techniques such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines (SVM, together with Ensemble Learning and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) to solve the classification problem of predicting whether an adult has Autistic Spectrum Disorder (ASD).
